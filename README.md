# a-life-time-time-counter
'a life time' is a project of slow interaction. it contains 80 RGB LED Neopixels, each pixel represents 1 year. people being chased by time everyday, the clock is the main thing to see how time flies away... ‘a life time’ allows you to experiece time slowly by slowing down the visual experiece, to allow you to see time in long term. people are able to see how many years they have left in this world slowly. 
eveything is going to fast these days...  i hope this project brings up the idea of slow design, and through this project, i try to change the way people see and experience things, to make time "go slow".
